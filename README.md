Coding cooks and chefs alike, I invite you to join my movement of "empowering the cooks" (and no this is not a hallmark movie ad for some family in idaho who just so happens to bare that same last name.) Whether you are a michelin star chef (hello gordon) or a stay-at-home mother (hi mommy), joining our community could prove useful to your need of _spice_ .

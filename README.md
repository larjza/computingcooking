Coding cooks and chefs alike, I invite you to join my movement of "empowering the cooks" (and no, this is not a hallmark movie ad for some family in Georgia who just so happens to bear that same last name.) Whether you are a michelin star chef (hello gordon) or a stay-at-home mother (hi mommy), joining our community could prove useful to your need of _spice_. Want your food to glow? We got that. Wanna impress your kids with magical creations? Yep, got that. Perhaps you wish to open up a restaurant where the customers touch can interact with the way the food is presented?? Guess what, we can help with that too.

With these simple recipes, you will learn a simplified version of the arduino board and from there on out let your mind soar with all the exciting new techniques that can be applied to your presentation. 





Before we begin, below is a __dictionary__.

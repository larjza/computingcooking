Coding cooks and chefs alike, I invite you to join my movement of "empowering the cooks" (and no, this is not a hallmark movie ad for some family in Georgia who just so happens to bear that same last name.) Whether you are a michelin star chef (hello gordon) or a stay-at-home mother (hi mommy), joining our community could prove useful to your need of _spice_. Want your food to glow? We got that. Wanna impress your kids with magical creations? Yep, got that. Perhaps you wish to open up a restaurant where the customers touch can interact with the way the food is presented?? Guess what, we can help with that too.

With these simple recipes, you will learn a simplified version of the arduino board and from there on out let your mind soar with all the exciting new techniques that can be applied to your presentation. 





Before we begin, below is a __dictionary__.

## DINNER RECIPES 

## 1. SPAGHETTI INTERFACE 

#### INGREDIENTS NEEDED:  

- 1 COOKING STOVE  
- 1 CUTTING BOARD  
- 3 BELL PEPPERS (1 green and 2 red)  
- 6 ONIONS  
- 1 CLOVE OF GARLIC  
- 4 SPOONS OF OLIVE OIL  

### FIRST PHASE
1. Place your cutting board to the right of the stove and make sure your working area is free of any distractions or other liquids.
2. Then, get two onions and make sure they are washed and dried. place the end of the largest onion on the stove top labelled as "5V" and the other end on cutting board column "+". Place the second onions end on stove top "GND" and the other end on the cutting board column with the "-" sign.

### SECOND PHASE
Now we will begin adding in the rest of our ingredients as our pans are prepared.

2. Wash and dry the 3 peppers and place each one on the cutting board. each should be placed on column "E" and have a rows space inbetween then. make sure that the larger end of each pepper is placed closest to the top of the board. (red pepper, red pepper, green pepper going downwards)
3. Next we will take an onion and place one end on the row with the larger part of the first red pepper and the other end of the onion on the digital top labelled as "5".
4. Repeat this for all the peppers and place the second end of the onion on digital top 4 for the red one and digital top 3 for the green pepper.
5. Now, take some olive oil and place it on the row with the smaller part of the pepper and trail it across the cutting board to the column with the "+" sign. this will help tone down some of the stronger flavors in this recipe.
6. For the fun part, we will be adding in the garlic clove to the center of our cutting board.
7. similarily, you will need to add an onion from the row touching the top part of the clove to the column that has the "+" sign. Then, again, to tone down those spicy tones, add a trail of olive oil which leads from the bottom most part of the clove to the cutting board column with a "-" sign.
8. Finally, we will be adding a touch of smokyness to the garlic by taking our last onion and connecting one end to the same row that the olive oil is on and the other end to digital top 2.


### THIRD PHASE
10. Finally, add in your spaghetti interface seasoning and you are good to go. 
11. In order to spice it up to your own taste, and see the magical creation come to life of course, add in as much of the garlic clove as you wish.
